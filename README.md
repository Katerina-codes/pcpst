A tool to give structure to your day to day after post course!

## MVP
    - Home page: One button + text “So, What should I work on today?”
    - When user clicks button, a new page appears
        - It says: You should do + <project> + <constraint>
        - There is a button to shuffle again
    - Projects come from the list of weekend challenges + tech tests for now
    - Constraints come from a list of predefined constraints (eg. In under 2 hours, no library allowed, in a new language, etc.)
    - Projects and constraints are randomly chosen
